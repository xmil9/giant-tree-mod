Minecraft mod that generates gigantic trees.

Requires Forge 1.7.10. It's quite outdated but with some effort could be brought up to date.

The trees grow over time and reach into the clouds. To grow the trees I used a technique to duplicate blocks randomly but to only retain them if they are located inside the boundaries of given geometric shapes, e.g. cylinders for trunk and branches, triangles for the canopy.
